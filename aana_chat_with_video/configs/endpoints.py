endpoints: list[dict] = []

# Add your endpoints here.
#
# For example:
# endpoints.append(
#     {
#         "name": "predict",
#         "path": "/predict",
#         "summary": "Predict the class of an image.",
#         "endpoint_cls": PredictEndpoint,
#     }
# )
#
# Endpoints can be created by inheriting from the `Endpoint` class.
# Put your endpoint classes in a separate files in the `endpoints` directory and import them here.
# See https://github.com/mobiusml/aana_sdk/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#endpoints in how to create endpoints.
